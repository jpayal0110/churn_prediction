## Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using a logistic regression model. By analyzing customer data and identifying patterns, the model helps in understanding which customers are likely to leave, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to improve retention.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, scaled numerical features, and performed one-hot encoding on categorical variables.
- **Model Development**: Built a logistic regression model to predict customer churn.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix to derive actionable insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLTK**: Applied for text preprocessing tasks.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Utilized for data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: Employed for model development and evaluation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd churn-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook churn_prediction.ipynb
   ```

## Results
The model's evaluation results in key metrics provided insights into customer behavior, helping in devising strategies to improve customer retention.

## Future Improvements
- Explore other machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost for improved prediction accuracy.
- Implement a feature selection technique to enhance model performance.
- Expand the analysis to include more customer demographics.
